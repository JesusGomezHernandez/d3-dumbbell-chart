# d3-dumbbell-chart

This is a dumbbell chart created using the d3.js library. This type of chart is particularly good at showing changes over time. 

In this case, the chart shows the change in unemployment rate in Spain in 2017 from january to december. 

With some input mechanisms, interactivity could be added to this chart, with smooth transitions. Axes can be trivially labeled.

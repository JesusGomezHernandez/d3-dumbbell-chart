# d3-dumbbell-chart

This is a dumbbell chart created using the d3.js library. This type of chart is particularly good at showing changes over time. 

In this case, the chart shows the change in the number of Jeeps in inventory 30 days from now for a particular auto dealership. The estimates were generated from a Bayesian survival model. 

With some input mechanisms, interactivity could be added to this chart, with smooth transitions. Axes can be trivially labeled.
